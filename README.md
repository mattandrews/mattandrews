===========

Source for my personal URL.

This is a flask app. To run:

    virtualenv ve
    source ve/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python matt.py
    
To deploy remotely, you'll need to uncomment the `local_settings.py` fields on the remote server.

This feels a bit bizarre to describe the run process: if you're not me, you're very unlikely to want to run/deploy this site...
