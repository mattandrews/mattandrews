<p>My name is Matt and I'm a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-andrews">web developer working at The Guardian</a>. It goes without saying but this blog does not represent the views or opinions of my employer.</p>
<p>Now that's out of the way, a little about this site: Three Chords is a blog with the intention of giving me somewhere to think out loud (so to speak) on technology, the internet, society and culture. It may or may not just be me ranting about things that annoy me in the guise of pseudoÂ journalism. The name is from the old punk concept of "three chords and the truth" - all you need to start a band. It's not really relevant to the site, but what are you going to do?</p>
<p>For more information about me, links to stuff I've made and contact info, <a href="http://mattandrews.info">check out my vanity URL</a>.</p>
