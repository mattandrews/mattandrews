<p>The Guardian’s Digital Development teams are out of the office and spending two days trying new ideas, starting things, breaking things and generally seeing what could be possible. Day one will be mainly the kick off, idea discussions and some initial hacking about. Day two will be frantic hacking leading up to presentations, awards and lots of fun.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-07-15T16:25:28.245Z">5.25pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p>And we've ended the day on a well-deserved standing ovation for the Hack Day committee, who put this all together.
