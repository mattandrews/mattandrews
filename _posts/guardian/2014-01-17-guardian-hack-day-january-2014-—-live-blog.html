<p>The Guardian’s Digital Development teams are out of the office and spending two days trying new ideas, starting things, breaking things and generally seeing what could be possible. Day one will be mainly the kick off, idea discussions and some initial hacking about. Day two will be frantic hacking leading up to presentations, awards and lots of fun.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-01-17T17:58:24.358Z">5.58pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>So the votes have been counted, double checked by an independent judge (full disclosure, they weren’t).

Nick works on our <a href="http://explorer.content.guardianapis.com/#/">Content API</a> and has a myriad of ideas he wants to try out. I'm worried his demo tomorrow might take longer than he has available!</p><p>First up&nbsp;is a notification service for the Content API, a constant stream of events; attempting to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;caching for the Content API; playing around with Netflix's open source tool called <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html">Chaos Monkey</a>&nbsp;to test how resilient our infrastructure is; possibly writing a client for the Content API in Clojure. Why Clojure&nbsp;you might ask? Well, because he likes it. It is also an attempt to smuggle it in. I bet our Architects will keep a beady eye on him.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-01-16T17:09:15.076Z">5.09pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>New chatting opportunity has come up with <a href="https://twitter.com/jenny_sivapalan">Jenny Sivapalan</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://twitter.com/yrrebjr">Robert Berry</a>. However, well, umm, it isn't for public consumption so let's move on quickly.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/chriscross_uk">Chris Cross </a>is working with the football data we have from our external sources. He is trying to pull together something that might visualise the pitch at any point of the match and update it&nbsp;&nbsp;in real time.

He is creating a service that takes a data set (like page views) and converts it to a sparkline on the server and passes back a png to the requesting service. This means that within our editorial tools, we can show visually how an individual piece of content is performing at a glance. I really hope this one works in prod by the end of tomorrow.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-01-16T16:28:36.849Z">4.28pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Grabbing 5 minutes with <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanClarke">Sean Clarke</a> who heads up our UK Interactives team.
