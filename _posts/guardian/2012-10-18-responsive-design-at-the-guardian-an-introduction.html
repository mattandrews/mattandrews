<p>The rise of "responsive design", as the technique was coined by Ethan Marcotte in his now-classic <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/"><em>A List Apart</em> article of the same name</a>, is currently making waves all over the web. Perhaps most prominently displayed in the high-profile relaunch of the <a href="http://bostonglobe.com/">Boston Globe</a> (a project presided over by Marcotte himself), it's also been used in recent revamps of more home-grown websites, including <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/">Channel 4 News</a> and <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News</a>. </p><p>Here at the Guardian we've been keen to dive into this approach ourselves. The benefits to us as developers are clear: we can avoid the headache of re-implementing features and concepts across multiple platforms multiple times, and streamline our release process to allow us to push updates and enhancements out to several of these platforms simultaneously. The benefit to the end user is the experience of browsing a webpage which is tailored for their particular viewing context, rather than attempting a one-size-fits-all approach which either forces everybody into a lowest common denominator pigeon hole, or assumes a high bar of entry which not all visitors can match.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/developer-blog/2012/oct/18/responsive-design-guardian-introduction">Continue reading...</a>
