<p>In the history of unlikely friendships, few perhaps have had the freedom of a nation underpinning them. The apparently<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/19/dennis-rodman-returns-north-korea"> burgeoning companionship</a> between Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un, however, could have profound implications for the people of North Korea.</p><p>When news of the former basketball star's trips to the "hermit kingdom" first broke in February, it was treated with the same wry amusement as the story of the discovery of a mythical "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/30/unicorn-lair-discovered-north-korea">unicorn lair</a>" in Pyongyang.

When you have the whole country out at 3am to build statues and sh*t – for free – that makes you a real leader [laughs]. You don't pay them, and they still love you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/20/dennis-rodman-north-korea-human-rights">Continue reading...</a>
