<p>It’s that time again – the Guardian’s Digital Development team is having its quarterly Hack Day. Follow along to see what gets built (and how much coffee gets drunk)</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T18:05:59.250Z">6.05pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p><strong>Dominic Kendrick</strong> takes the award for most amusing hack with his cautionary environmental tale <em>Choose Wisely</em>.</p><p>The Graham Tackley memorial award for most valuable hack controversially goes to <em>Do you come here often?</em></p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:18:47.755Z">5.18pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>And that’s it! Now its time for the voting.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:16:14.737Z">5.16pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Last hack! Applause for these two waiting to go until the very end of the day.</p><p>Zofia Korcz and Justin Pinner have been working on making the Guardian 404 pages more useful. Justin kicks off by pointing out this is not the most helpful page (at all). Short and sweet they demo their far more thoughtfully crafted page with clear onward journeys.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:15:00.485Z">5.15pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Another round of singing for another birthday. Hurrah!</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:13:58.054Z">5.13pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Some light trolling of <a href="http://www.whereiscantlin.com/">Cantlin Ashrowan</a> in Seb and Lindsey’s talk. I look forward to that article exposing ageing hipsters.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:12:17.933Z">5.12pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Hangu by Seb Cevey and Lindsey Dew is about making editorial lives easier, integrating a hangout with content production inside the tool itself.</p><p>It’s like a chat channel inside the tools that builds on our internal user presence indicators. You can chat with individuals or have a “room” around the content. It also integrates with Google Chat so chats are integrated with Gmail (the primary channel for chat inside the Guardian offices).</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:08:08.139Z">5.08pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>They have created an additional option for the app that allows an editor to open Ophan directly from the app (we use browser extensions for these kind of tools on the web).</p><p>The website has a heatmap overlay that records where clicks on the page are happening. Again as an option you can see how many clicks the native front components are getting in near realtime.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:04:17.684Z">5.04pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>I’ve left a bunch of accents off Frederic’s name, sorry.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:03:13.615Z">5.03pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p><a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/how-ophan-offers-bespoke-data-to-inform-content-at-the-guardian/s2/a563349/">Ophan</a> is our internal analytics tool and Frederic, Jesus and Diego from the native apps team are going to talk about how they can create an app experience for it.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:03:05.222Z">5.03pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Team M.A.R.I.O. (Making All Readers Involved in the Observer) up now by Frank Hulley-Jones, Rob Phillips and of course Mario Andrade.</p><p>The Guardian has gorgeous supplements in the paper on the weekend but they are nowhere to be found on the website. This team has created beautiful pages for the web designed to make you feel like having a nice long read over a cup of coffee. </p><p>Creating bespoke sites for <a href="https://twitter.com/guardianweekend">@guardianweekend</a> sections <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/guhackday15?src=hash">#guhackday15</a> <a href="http://t.co/Fp8dyvjCf2">pic.twitter.com/Fp8dyvjCf2</a></p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T17:01:09.611Z">5.01pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Another single-person hack, Nick Satterly has created On this day. A Guardian digest for a particular day. Nick is nostalgic for our old frontend and I suspect some of you reading are too, one thing it did was a summary of a day, however that was based on the newspaper and Nick’s is based on what the audience were discussing on a given day.</p><p>You can <a href="http://onthisday-theguardian.herokuapp.com/today">see Nick’s hack for yourself</a>. This is the coverage <a href="http://onthisday-theguardian.herokuapp.com/2015/01/07">the day after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices</a>.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:56:40.706Z">4.56pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p><strong>Come here often? </strong>Here’s hoping. </p><p>Chris Clarke, John Duffell, Chris Austin and Steve Vadocz are targeting the large percentage of visitors who only visit the Guardian once and leave. They are tailoring the experience based on where you have come from. Facebook users should get more scrolling whereas Google referrals probably know exactly what they want, so keep it short and sweet.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:54:02.801Z">4.54pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>There are going to be just under forty hacks to vote on and only three prizes. It is going to be hard to remember all the hacks let alone vote on them!</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:51:36.653Z">4.51pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Snapchat content is about “brand awareness”. The average Guardian reader is aged about 37, there isn’t really any content on the site aimed at them.</p><p>It’s not really clear what the app is about but I think the idea is to create a dedicated app with a less conservative design aesthetic.</p><p>Targeting a younger audience for the Guardian, nice work by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattpointblank">@mattpointblank</a> and co <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/guhackday15?src=hash">#guhackday15</a> <a href="http://t.co/GBiQLkC9dv">pic.twitter.com/GBiQLkC9dv</a></p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:48:18.993Z">4.48pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p><strong>The Power is YOURS! </strong>Hot tips to save the planet is on by Steve Vadocz, Mario Andrade and Michael McNamara. </p><p>Michael explains this is about recruiting our users as a force for change.

Also Wendy is disgruntled that I thought her hack name was sinister, but it is so she’s just going to have to be unhappy (or rename it) to “Cuddly hug links”.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:42:29.850Z">4.42pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>The Guardian has a lot of community products: comments, Witness, Professional Networks and indeed the Opinion section where external contributors are encouraged to provide their personal view.</p><p>It’s demo time yo!</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:38:44.516Z">4.38pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>We’re opening with some call and response, Adam’s always the showman.

You can explore topics deeply as you continue to watch the current video. There is also a personal playlist that you can add videos to so that you can create a little backlog of videos you want to watch later. Its called <em>Down the rabbit hole</em>, watch video endlessly!</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:29:52.195Z">4.29pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>The next hack is called <em>Where do you think you’re going?</em> Seems a little sinister for a personalisation hack... This is an attempt to link the link the sponsored content we run in things like the Travel section to news about the areas, making it easy to visit if you want to.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:27:07.506Z">4.27pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Podcast player by Richard Nguyen is up now.

The voice synthesis is good but still a little bit creepy.</p><p>One of the features is that you can have the comments read to you while you read the article. Save your time by using all your senses!</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2015-02-27T16:16:02.147Z">4.16pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Up next is NightVision 2.0 by Gwyn Lockett.
