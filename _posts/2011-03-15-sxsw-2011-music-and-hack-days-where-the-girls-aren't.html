<p>A couple of notes to preface this entry: Firstly: I'm indebted to Jessica Hopper of Punk Planet, whose famous column <a href="http://blogcritics.org/music/article/where-the-girls-arent/">"Emo: Where the girls aren't"</a> I've shamelessly plundered for this entry's title. Secondly: greater minds than mine have written extensively on the subject of women in programming and I can only claim to be a mostly uninformed but interested observer. With that out of the way, let's begin ...</p><p>A great talk by <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2010/08/06/friday-fun-meet-dave-haynes/">Dave Haynes of Soundcloud</a> and <a href="http://the.echonest.com/company/management/">Matthew Ogle of Echo Nest</a> got me thinking about the industry and its direction. The very first slide in the <a href="http://jemimakiss.tumblr.com/post/3858002377/love-music-and-apis">Love, Music and APIs talk</a> proclaimed, rightly, that "Developers are crucial to the future of music". I'd probably go for even stronger terms than "crucial" and maybe say developers are the future of music, but it was their talk, not mine. Full marks for an interesting and inspirational talk, which my colleague <a href="http://jemimakiss.tumblr.com/post/3858002377/love-music-and-apis">Robbie Clutton has already written about here</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/15/sxsw-2011-music-hack-days">Continue reading...</a>
